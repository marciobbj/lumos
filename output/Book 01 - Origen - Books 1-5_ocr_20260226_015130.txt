BOOK ONE

AUL, A SLAVE OF JESUS CHRIST.! We have already

spoken about Paul. Now let us try to find out why he is
| called a slave here, seeing that elsewhere he writes, “For
you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back again into fear,
but the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’”?
And again, “Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his
own Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father!” So you are no
longer a slave but a son.”® Why, therefore, does he declare him-
self to be a slave to people to whom he has previously said, “You
are no longer a slave but a son”? We shall not be in error if we
consider it to be an expression of that humility which the Lord
taught when he said, “Learn from me, for I am meek and hum-
ble in heart.”* Nor is the truth of Paul’s freedom violated by
this. For he himself says, “For though I am free from all, I have
made myself a slave to all.”® He serves Christ, then, not in a
spirit of slavery but in the Spirit of adoption because being a
slave of Christ is more distinguished than any freedom. Or it
may be that he utters these words as an imitator of him who
had said, “Behold I am among you not as one reclining at the
table but as one who serves”;® and of him who “emptied him-
self, taking the form of a slave.”” Just as he himself becomes
one under the law for those who are under the law, and for
those who are without the law he himself even becomes one
without the law,® so also, if he becomes a slave for the sake of
those who are still slaves and who have not yet been led
through the Spirit of adoption to the freedom of sons, it will
not seem contradictory.

BOOK 1, CHAPTER 1 61

(2) We can add the following to these things: When this
same Apostle writes to the Corinthians and gives instructions
about marriage and chastity, he inserts some things concerning
freedom and slavery, as if on external authority, saying, “Were
you a slave when called? Do not be concerned. Even if you can
gain your freedom, make use of it instead. For whoever was
called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman; likewise,
whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ. You were
bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.” To at least
some people these words appear to have been introduced illog-
ically. For why is [M839] mention made of slavery and freedom
in the midst of instructions about marriage and chastity? But
we understand Paul’s thought in this way: He is calling a man a
slave who has been bound to the matrimonial state because
“the wife does not have authority over her own body, but her
husband does; and the husband does not have authority over
his own body, but his wife does.”!? This is why he says of them in
another passage, “the brother or sister is not subjected to servi-
tude in such cases”;!! obviously because in other cases he would
understand them to be subjected to servitude. Therefore a per-
son who comes to Christ while married is called a slave, to
whom he says, “Were you a slave when called? Do not let it be of
consequence to you. Even if you can gain your freedom, make
use of it instead.”’? The reason he says this is because among
married persons the freedom of continence of one partner can
endanger the chastity of the other. For they are not obligated
except by mutual consent for a time in order to be free for
prayer. Then they ought to return again to the same lest Satan
tempt them owing to their lack of self control.?® Therefore he
who has been called a slave on account of the marriage bond is
the Lord’s freedman. A freedman is neither entirely free nor is
he entirely a slave. Consequently, he who is a slave owing to
marriage, if he becomes free respecting the rest of the virtues,
if he takes hold of the freedom of faith, patience, mercy, and

righteousness, he is called the Lord’s freedman, inasmuch as
he is free for the sake of the virtues of his mind, and he is a
slave for the sake of marital obligation. He is indeed free who
comes to Christ without a wife through the purity of conti-
nence, however he is made a slave of Christ when he serves the
virtues completely.

(g) Paul, then, if certain traditions are true, was called while
in possession of a wife, concerning whom he speaks when writ-
ing to the Philippians, “I ask you also, my loyal mate, help these
women.”!* Since he had become free by mutual consent with
her,”” he calls himself a slave of Christ. But if, as others think,
he had no wife, nonetheless he who was free when he was
called is yet a slave of Christ. In fact what does it mean to be a
slave of Christ? It means that one is a slave of the Word of God,
of wisdom, righteousness, truth, and of absolutely all the virtues
which are identical with Christ himself.!®

(4) But if it seems fitting, let us add this: Just as knowledge
and prophecy and other gifts of the Holy Spirit!” which are now
being given to the saints are given “in a mirror” and “in a rid-
dle,”'® so also the freedom which is now offered to the saints is
not yet full freedom but “as in [M840] a mirror and in a rid-
dle,”" and for this reason saints call themselves slaves in com-
parison with that freedom which shall be granted “face to
face.”® For who is there placed in the flesh who is able to attain
such complete freedom that he no longer serves the flesh in
any respect whatsoever? In the same way it is not possible for
someone who has been placed in a body to possess the adop-
tion of sons completely.?! If only one could at least attain in this
mortal life to this, that whoever completely becomes a slave of
Christ would serve neither flesh, nor blood, nor vainglory, nor
greed, nor wrath, nor envy, but Christ alone, that is to say, all

the virtues simultaneously. These are the things concerning
that which is written, “Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ.”

2. Called to be an apostle?®> The word “called” can be viewed as
a general term because it applies to all who believe in Christ.
However each person individually is called either an apostle,
prophet, teacher, a man free from a wife, or a slave to the mar-
riage bond,* according to what God foresees and chooses. And
for the sake of the diversity of grace, that which has been writ-
ten, “Many are called but few are chosen,”* is fulfilled. Never-
theless one should recognize that it is possible for someone to
be a called apostle or a called prophet or a called teacher and,
should he neglect the grace of his calling, to fall away from it.
This is precisely what happened in the case of Judas, who had
been called to be an apostle but, by neglecting the grace of his
calling, changed from being an apostle to a traitor.* He was in-
deed called to be an apostle but he was not chosen to be an
apostle. Moreover the prophet who is reported in the Third
Book of Kingdoms to have prophesied about Jeroboam was
called to be a prophet. But whether he was also chosen you
yourself must ascertain since, although forbidden to eat bread
in Israel, he ate and was subsequently killed by a lion.? There
are also many called to be teachers in all of God’s churches and
called to be ministers, but I do not know who among them are
chosen teachers and chosen ministers. In this way as well there
are, in my opinion, certain people who are indeed called to suf-
fer for Christ and yet they are not chosen. That is to say, they
are called to be martyrs but are not chosen to be martyrs, since
there are those who do not hold out to the end in the en-
durance of confession after the struggles of tortures and pris-
ons. And there is also the virgin who is called but is not chosen
a virgin, [M841] namely the one who will not be holy in body
and spirit.?” There is also the shepherd who is called but is not
chosen a shepherd, who indeed presides over the flock, enjoys

its milk, and is covered with its wool, but he does not search for
the weak and bind up the lame and employ the strong with la-
bor.?® In the same way there is someone called to be abstinent
but [M842] is not chosen to be abstinent, certainly anyone who
fasts in a sullen manner, distorting his countenance in order to
please men.? You will, in like manner, find many persons at
each level of the spiritual gifts who are called, but few who are
chosen.®

3. Set apart for the gospel of God.®' In Paul’s case [M843] not
only is a general calling to apostleship described® but also a
choosing according to the foreknowledge of God,* which fol-
lowed immediately, through which he is said to be set apart for
the gospel of God. In this manner he says elsewhere about him-
self, “But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb,
was pleased to reveal his Son in me.”* The heretics, however,
invoke this text for the purpose of calumny, saying that Paul was
set apart from [M844] his mother’s womb because goodness
was inherent in his nature; just as, in contrast, it says in the
Psalms of those who are evil in nature, “For they have been set
apart as sinners from the womb.”%

(2) But we maintain that Paul was not chosen due to chance
or a special nature, but rather he himself gave the reasons for
his own election as found in himself and in the One who
“knows all things before they take place.”®” Nor are the sinners
who are set apart from the womb set apart by an unjust judg-
ment. [M84r] After all, look at the immediate context and see
what the divine text says concerning them. For it is written,
“They have been set apart as sinners from the womb; they
have gone astray from their birth, they have spoken lies.”* If
we understand in what sense sinners have gone astray from
their mothers’ wombs and have spoken lies, we shall equally un-

derstand at once that they are set apart from the womb de-
servedly.

(g) It says then that Paul was set apart for the gospel and set
apart from his own mother’s womb. The reasons for this and
the merits which entitled him to be set apart for this purpose
were seen by the One from whom man’s mind does not
escape.” For God foresaw that Paul was going to labor harder
than all the others in the gospel;* that, despite hunger and
thirst, cold and nakedness, dangers from thieves, dangers from
rivers, dangers at sea, he was going to preach the gospel of
Christ,*! knowing that it would have been woe to him if he did
not preach the gospel;** and that he was going to punish his
body and reduce it to slavery, so that, after proclaiming to oth-
ers, he himself should not be rejected.* Therefore, seeing in
advance these things and many other similar things in him,
God set Paul apart for the gospel from his mother’s womb on
account of these matters. For if, as [M846] the heretics think,
he had been chosen either by uncertain fate or by the privilege
of possessing a superior nature, surely he would never have ex-
pressed the fear that, if he were not to hold the restraints on his
own body, it could potentially come to pass that he would be re-
jected** or that woe would be his if he were to cease from pro-
claiming the gospel.®

(4) After all, later in the letter he himself explains this more
fully when he says, “For those whom he foreknew he also pre-
destined to be conformed to the image of his Son.”*® Plainly
showing that those whom God foreknew would become the
kind to conform themselves to Christ by their sufferings, he
even predestined them to be conformed and similar to his im-
age and glory. Therefore there precedes a foreknowledge of
them, through which is known what effort and virtue they will

knowledge. Pelagius followed Origen in seeing “calling” based upon praevisa
merita “foreseen merits.”

possess in themselves, and thus predestination follows, yet fore-
knowledge should not be considered the cause of predestina-
tion. For while men requite merit to each individual based
upon past accomplishments, for God this is determined from
future ones; and a person is very impious not to concede to
God that what we see in the past he can see in the future.*’

(5) “Set apart,” he says, “for the gospel of God.” Other pas-
sages of Scripture speak of the gospel of Christ, [M847] as the
evangelist Mark writes, “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus
Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet.”® In truth since
Christ is the Word, and “in the beginning he was with God, and
the Word was God,”* then the gospel of God and the gospel of
Christ signify one and the same thing.’® For the Lord himself
says “I and the Father are one.” And again he says to the Fa-
ther, “All which is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine; and I
have received glory in them.”®? Accordingly the gospel of the
Father is the gospel of the Son. Yet Paul also says, “my gospel
which I proclaim among the Gentiles.”>® He says this perhaps as
a coheir of Christ® and just as if a coheir in the gospel. For else-
where he says additionally that the gospel belongs to many per-
sons. For example to the Galatians [Corinthians]% he writes,
“But even if our gospel is veiled.”*® “Our” means everyone who
are coheirs of Christ. And indeed, in accordance with the fact
that he himself is its proclaimer, Paul rightly calls it his own
gospel.”’

tures, or to the distinction of another gospel which John calls in
the Apocalypse “eternal,”™ which is to be revealed at that time
when the shadow passes away and the truth comes and when
death shall be swallowed up® and eternity restored, I leave for
you the reader to consider.®! Those eternal years spoken of by
the prophet evidently correspond with this eternal gospel: “I
kept in mind the eternal years.”> With the eternal gospel can
also be associated the book of life, in which the names of the
saints are said to be written down,® as can those books which,
in Daniel, were opened when the court was seated,® or those in
Ezekiel the prophet which are said to be inscribed on the in-
side and outside,*® and all the things that are recounted as hav-
ing been written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living
God.%

them apart from the gospel; nor to us men, to whom it says he
was sent to preach the good news to the poor, to release the
captives in remission, and to proclaim the accepted year of the
Lord.™ Well then, if, when he appeared to us men, he did not
appear apart from the gospel, it seems consistent to declare
that he did not appear to the angelic order apart from the

(4) Now whether we should also assume that such a thing
was accomplished by him among the other heavenly orders of
beings, that he appeared to each of them in their own form
and announced peace, since he indeed made peace through
the blood of his cross not only with things on earth but also
with the heavenly beings,” this too is a question you yourself
must investigate.”™

(5) “Which he promised through his prophets in the Holy
Scriptures.” One should understand the things predicted about
Christ through the prophets as things which have been predict-
ed about the gospel as well, even though the evangelist Mark
appears to make a distinction between Christ and the gospel
when he says, “He who has left father and mother,” etc., “for my
sake or for the sake of the gospel.”” But even if one demands
promises strictly of the gospel you will find them abundantly in
the prophets. For example, “The Lord shall give the word with
much power to those who preach the gospel”;”” and, “How
beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim the gospel tid-
ings.”™ Also regarding this is, “Their sound went forth in all the
earth and their words unto the end of the world”;”” and, “His
word runs swiftly.”® There is also a promise of the gospel in Je-
remiah, “Behold I am sending many shepherds® and many
hunters, and they shall catch them upon every mountain and
upon every hill.”® This is what Paul is now speaking of when he
says that God “promised [it] through his prophets in the Holy
Scriptures.”

5. Concerning his Son.*® He who was a son according to the
flesh came indeed from the seed of David. Undoubtedly, he be-
came that which previously was not, according to the flesh. Ac-
cording to the Spirit, however, he existed first, and there was
never a time when he was not® It should be noted that
[M849] he did not say, “who has been predestined Son of God
in power according to the Spirit of holiness,” but, “who has
been destined the Son of God.”® Let no one think that we are
scrutinizing the words used here more carefully than the mat-
ter allows. For even though it is customary to find “predes-
tined” in the Latin copies,® the correct translation here is
“destined” and not “predestined.” For only a person who is in
existence can be destined; but to be predestined applies to
someone who is not yet in existence, such as those, concerning
whom the Apostle says, “Those whom he foreknew these he
also predestined.”® Accordingly those who do not yet exist can
be foreknown and predestined, but he who is and who always is,
is not predestined but destined.® We should mention this on
account of those who utter blasphemies against the only begot-
ten Son of God and, ignorant of the distinction between “des-
tined” and “predestined,” they imagine that he ought to be
counted among those who were predestined to exist when they
previously did not exist. But he was never predestined to be the
Son, but he always was, just as also the Father. So then, he who
always is, is destined, as we have said, not predestined. But one

325, became infamous for his slogan, v ToTe 6Te olk My, “There was a time
when he was not,” referring to the time before the Son was created. Origen’s
expression clearly anticipates the Nicene and Athanasian definitions. Cf. Bigg,
Christian Platonists, p. 167, “There is no shadow of a doubt that for Origen the
Son is co-eternal and co-equal with the Father.” Cf. 10.8.5; Princ 1.1.2; 1.2.9;

who is predestined did not yet exist at the time he was predes-
tined, but he began at some point in time.* The Apostle is
therefore making a critical distinction when he refers to him as
“made of the seed of David according to the flesh,” but calls
him destined “the Son of God in power according to the Spirit
of holiness.”

(2) Furthermore when he said “Son of God” he did not add
the words, “in power,” superfluously,” by this indicating that he
is the Son substantially according to the Spirit of holiness. For
Christ is called “the power of God and the wisdom of God,”
which is also named “the breath of the power of God, and the
purest emanation of the glory of the Almighty” and “the splen-
dor of eternal light and the image of God’s goodness.”? Now
the next question is: If that which is born from David’s seed is
according to the flesh, but that which is destined in power, ac-
cording to the Spirit of holiness, is the Son of God and substan-
tially God, how ought we to understand the soul of Jesus, which
is by no means named with the flesh and [M850] the Spirit of
holiness, or even with the substance of the divine power? Else-
where the Savior himself says of his soul, “My soul is grieved
unto the point of death,” and, “now is my soul troubled.”*
This is the soul he lays down of his own accord;® and yes, in
fact it even descended to the underworld, concerning which it
is also said, “You will not abandon my soul in the under-
world.”® For it is beyond any doubt that this soul was not gener-
ated from the seed of David. For it says that what was made
from the seed of David is according to the flesh.

(3) Since therefore the soul is evidently included neither in

89. Erasmus’s clarification of this passage (CWE 56:11) is most helpful:
“Origen seems to have thought that ‘predestine’ has a double aspect of futurity
and ‘destine’ merely a single. For if I ‘destine’ a bride for a son of mine already
born, the person for whom I destine belongs to the present time, what I am
destining belongs to the future. But if I resolve to dedicate to the study of theol-
ogy the son who will be born first, then both the person and the thing belong
to future time; and Origen would have the world ‘predestine’ refer to cases of

the latter type.”

that which is according to the flesh nor in that which is des-
tined to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of
holiness, it is my belief that the Apostle is using his customary
habit in this passage,”” knowing that the soul is always midway
between the spirit and the flesh and that it joins itself either to
the flesh, thus becoming one with the flesh, or it associates it-
self with the spirit and becomes one with the spirit.”® Conse-
quently if it is joined with the flesh men become fleshly; but if it
unites with the spirit they become spiritual. And for that reason
he does not explicitly designate the soul but only the flesh and
the spirit. For he knows that the soul inevitably attaches itself to
one of these two aspects, as in those to whom he writes, “But
you are not in the flesh but in the spirit,” and, “Whoever
unites himself with a prostitute is one body,”'® here calling
“prostitute” the flesh or body. “But whoever unites himself with
the Lord is one Spirit.”!”! So then Paul, now aware that the soul
of Jesus, united with the Lord and attaching to him, was one
Spirit of holiness with him, thus does not designate it explicitly
lest he should break apart the unity of Jesus.!”> For “what God
has joined together let man not separate.”!®® He is in truth
called the “Spirit of holiness” according to the fact that he
makes holiness available to all, just as it is written elsewhere
about him, “who has become wisdom for us from God, and
righteousness and holiness and redemption.”!*

(4) Still, some people!® attack us by raising the most aggra-
vating questions. For example: How can Christ be descended
from the seed of David when it is an established fact that he was
not born of Joseph, in whom Joseph’s lineage as a descendant
of David [M851] is adduced?!® Although it is vexing to re-
spond to these people in the manner of a treatise, the following

shall nevertheless be answered from our side: “Before Mary,
who was betrothed, and Joseph came together, she was found to
be with child from the Holy Spirit.”!” Now according to the law
she was united to her own fellow tribe member and kinsman.!%®
And although it was told to her by the angel, “For behold Eliza-
beth your kinswoman shall herself give birth to a son in her old
age”;1% yet Elizabeth is said to be descended from the daugh-
ters of Aaron,'? nevertheless it will be affirmed on our side that
the term “kinsman” may be appropriately and interchangeably
applied not only to fellow tribe-members but also to everyone
who are of the race of Israel. In this way the Apostle himself
speaks likewise of all Israelites, “who are my kinsmen according
to the flesh.”!!! These types of responses and others similar to
them may be given. To what extent they may actually be effec-
tive against the assertions of those who press us concerning the
testimonies from the Scriptures, the reader shall have to test.
(5) All the same, in our view these matters should instead be
understood by using the spiritual or allegorical method of in-
terpretation. According to this method there is no problem in
Joseph being called the father of Christ even though he is not
at all his actual father.!"? For it is also recorded by Matthew in
the genealogy that Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat
Uzziah."® Yet in the fourth book of Kingdoms it is written that
Joram begat Ahaziah, and Ahaziah begat Joash, and Joash begat
Amaziah. Amaziah in fact begat Azariah, who is sometimes
called Uzziah, and Azariah begat Jotham."* Hence Uzziah, who
is also called Azariah, is said to be a son of Amaziah in the
third!® book of Kingdoms,!'® and yet in Matthew’s account he

have been skipped. The explanation of this matter is certainly
not established by the historical but by the spiritual understand-
ing. It is not the time for us to deal with these matters in pass-
ing. Instead they will be investigated in their proper place."® It
suffices us for the moment to respond to those who oppose us
that, just as Jesus is said to be a son of Joseph, from whom he
was not generated, and Uzziah is said to be generated from Jo-
ram, from whom he was not generated, so also is it possible to
understand that Christ was of David’s seed according to the
flesh. We would say that whatever defense and proof they pro-
duce in the case of Joram and Joseph should be accepted as
well in the case of David.

6. From the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.""® For
the person who reads the following Scripture, “It was fitting
that he, through whom and in whom all things exist, in bring-
ing many sons to glory, should make the author of their salva-
tion perfect through sufferings,”' it is not difficult to perceive
how he who is said to have been made from David’s seed ac-
cording to the flesh is, from the resurrection from the dead,
[M852] the Son of God.'?' The resurrection is indeed the end
of Christ’s sufferings, and because after the resurrection “he
dies not again and death will no longer have dominion over
him”;'* and it also says, “even though we knew Christ according
to the flesh, now we know him no longer in that way”;'# there-
fore everything that is in Christ is now the Son of God.'*!

Son of God in power is something that constrains our compre-
hension; unless it be that because of the inseparable unity of

the Word and flesh, everything that is of the flesh is attributed
to the Word also, since also the things which belong to the
Word are foretold in the flesh. For we often find the designa-
tions “Jesus” and “Christ” and “Lord” referred to both natures.
For example, “Our one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all
things”;'® and again, “For if they would have known they would
never have crucified the Lord of majesty.”!%

() Christ is called the first or “firstborn from the dead.”'?’
We need to investigate whether he alone is the firstborn or first
from the dead and has no other sharers with him in this status
of firstness. The Apostle says about this, “For he raised us up
with Christ and, at the same time, made us sit with him in the
heavenly places.”'* It may be the case that those who are said to
be raised up with Christ and seated with him in heavenly places
are the firstborn or first from the dead, like those individuals
who are said to have been raised with him when “the tombs
were opened and the bodies of many saints appeared and en-
tered into the holy city.”'® Possibly the Apostle is speaking
about such persons when he calls that city “the church of the
firstborn ones”'* which, he mentions, is written in heaven.!?!

7. Through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring
about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his

through Christ inasmuch as he is mediator of God and men.!®
“Grace and apostleship.” “Grace” must refer to the endurance
of labors, “apostleship” to the authority of proclamation. Even
Christ himself is called an apostle,’* i.e., one who has been

utes of the divine nature may be attributed to the human nature and vice versa.

sent to preach good news to the poor.”*® Everything which is
his, therefore, he gives to his disciples as well. It is said that
grace has been poured out on his lips.””” [M853] He also gives
grace to his own apostles with which they may say as they labor,
“I have labored harder than all of them; but not I but the grace
of God with me.”"®® And because it has been said about him,
“Therefore since we have a high priest and apostle of our con-
fession, Christ,”'* he gives to his disciples the dignity of apostle-
ship in order that they also might become apostles of God. For
the Gentiles who were “foreigners to the covenant of God and
the way of life of Israel”'*” were not able to believe the gospel
except through the grace which had been given to the apostles.
It is said that through this grace, as the apostles preach, men
obey through faith, and the sound of Christ’s name arising out
of their grace is recounted as having gone forth unto all the
earth'" so that it has even reached those who are in Rome. The
Apostle says to them, “among whom you also have been called
of Jesus Christ.”'*? Paul is said to be called an apostle;'** the Ro-
mans are indeed called, but not as apostles, but called to be
saints in the obedience of faith.'** We have already spoken

it is also the blessing in which Abraham was blessed by Mel-
chizedek!* and Jacob by his father Isaac'®® and the twelve patri-
archs by their father Israel;'"! or the blessing of Moses with
which he blessed the twelve tribes of Israel.’> Therefore I re-
gard the blessing with which the Apostle blessed the churches
of Christ not inferior to any of these other blessings. For he
himself says concerning himself, “I think that I too have the
Spirit of God.”®® Consequently the Apostle is writing in the
Spirit and he blesses in the Spirit. It is through that Spirit, then,
that those who are blessed by the Apostle shall obtain blessings,
provided that those upon whom his blessing comes are found
worthy. Otherwise what is written shall come to pass, “If a son of
peace is there, your peace will come on him; but if not, your
peace will return to you.”!> What is written about peace applies
also to grace since he joins grace and peace together. Neverthe-
less one should recognize that the Apostle does not observe
this custom when he writes to all the churches. To be sure he
writes in a similar way to [M8r4] the Corinthians in the first
and second letter, and to the Galatians and to the Ephesians
and to the Philippians.’® To the Colossians, however, he says,
“Grace be with you and peace from God our Father,”* and he
does not add, “and from our Lord Jesus Christ.” First Thessalo-
nians has the following, “Grace be with you and peace,”®” and
nothing more. But in the second letter, “Grace be with you and
peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”"* In
First and Second Timothy he writes, “Grace, mercy, and peace
from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord”;'* yet to Titus
he says, “Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus
our Savior.”'® And even though observations of this sort may
appear too inquisitive, nevertheless he who believes there is
nothing superfluous in the Holy Scriptures shall not regard
these differences and variations as matters of insignificance.

BOOK 1, CHAPTER 9 77

9. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because
your faith is proclaimed in the whole world."™® When writing to cer-
tain people the Apostle says he gives thanks for all of them, as
he does now in writing to the Romans. However when he writes
to others he indeed gives thanks but does not add the words,
“for all.” You shall discover if you look carefully that when he
says he gives thanks “for all” he does not amplify on particular
faults or serious charges of disgraceful conduct among them;
but when he singles out certain people or makes an accusation
he does not add to the thanksgiving that he gives thanks “for
all.” This is the case in the letters to the Corinthians and to
the Colossians.'®? Indeed in Galatians he does not write a
thanksgiving at all because he is amazed at them that they are
“so quickly turning away from him who called them unto an-
other gospel.”1%

(2) Thus his first expression in this letter starts with a word
of thanksgiving. Now to give thanks to God is to offer a sacrifice
of praise; and for that reason he adds, “through Jesus Christ,”
as through a great high priest.!** For whoever wants to offer a
sacrifice to God should know that he must offer it through the
hands of a high priest.!®

(3) Nor should the words “my God” be taken as superfluous.
For this expression cannot be anyone’s except these saints of
whom God is called, just as the God of Abraham or Isaac or Ja-
cob.'® The man whose belly is his god'®” or for whom greed is
god or the one for whom worldly glory and the ostentation of
the world or the power of perishable things is god cannot say
that God is his own.'® For whatever each person [M855] wor-
ships above all else is his god.

(4) Butlet us see what it is for which the Apostle gives thanks
to his God. He says, “because your faith is proclaimed in the
whole world.” If we interpret the words “in the whole world” in
a simple sense it would seem to denote that in many places of
the world, that is, of this earth, the faith and religion of those

who are in Rome is being proclaimed.'® But if, as in not a few
other passages, the world denoted here is the one which con-
sists of heaven and earth and everything in them, then it is pos-
sible to understand that the powers, of whom it is said, “they
have joy over one sinner who repents,”” are rejoicing far more
over the conversion and faith of the Romans, when the angels
who ascend and descend on the Son of Man announce it to
them.!” For they too are amazed at the conversion of the na-
tions and that the sound of the apostles of Christ Jesus has gone
forth into the whole earth.!'” After all, they even rejoice as they
behold the struggles of the saints in this world, as the Apostle
says, “For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to an-
gels and to men.”!”

(5) Yet it is also possible to understand this verse in the fol-
lowing way: That faith which the Romans possess is the very
same and no different than that which is being proclaimed and
believed in the whole world and which also will be preached
not only on earth but also in heaven. For Jesus has made peace
through his own blood not only with the things on earth but
also with the things in heaven.'”* And at the name of Jesus not
only do earthly beings bow the knee but also heavenly beings
and those which live in the underworld.!” This is what it means
when it says that their faith is being proclaimed in the whole
world. Through this faith the entire world is being subjected to
God.'”

(6) We take note, of course, that to the word “first” he does
not relate anything like, “and in the second place.”'”” However
we said in the Preface'™ that Paul’s style of speaking is incom-
plete. Possibly, however, it may be completed when he says later,
“Now, I want you to know, brothers.”!”

witnesses of God according to what he says through the proph-
et, “You shall be my witnesses and I am a witness, says the
Lord.”!8! Moreover the Savior says to the disciples, “You will be
my witnesses in Jerusalem, and Samaria, and to all the ends of
the earth,”'® according to which it is written, “Everyone who
confesses me, I also will confess him before my Father.”!18

(2) Let us now see why it is that he says, “whom I serve in my
spirit.” To serve in the spirit seems to me to be similar to, yes
and even something more than, to worship in the spirit.!8* As
[M856] the Lord himself said to the Samaritan, “Woman, the
hour will come, and is now here, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth.”'® But Paul not only
worships in the spirit, but he also serves in the spirit. For who
can worship without affection? But to serve pertains to one who
is constrained by affection. Accordingly the Apostle serves God
not in the body or in the soul but in his best part, in the spirit.
For when he writes to the Thessalonians he makes known that
these three aspects are in man when he says, “May your whole
body, soul, and spirit be preserved on the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ.”® And Daniel says, “Praise the Lord you spirits and
souls of the righteous.”'®” In accordance with this the Apostle
everywhere prefers the spirit and repudiates the flesh or that
which belongs to the flesh. After all, he himself praises the spir-
it of the law but spurns the letter as if flesh when he says, “The
letter kills but the spirit gives life.”!® But also when he says, “For
where the law was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,”’® doubtless he is calling the
“flesh of the law” the “letter of the law.” For through the letter
the law is weak so that it may not be fulfilled.!* For who could
fulfill what is written about the Sabbath, “You shall not move
from your place on the Sabbath”?'"! For how was it possible for

someone, deep down inside, not to move from his place? Or
what about the laws concerning leprous diseases that break out
on thread or on a wall or on a hide or the thousands of other
laws?19? It is on account of these laws that the law is weak ac-
cording to the letter, that is, according to the flesh. For that rea-
son, the Apostle says, “For the law is spiritual.”!®® Consequently
he who understands that the law is spiritual serves God in the
spirit. Whence also he says to others, “For if you live according
to the flesh, you will die,” that is to say, according to the letter
which kills; “but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of
the flesh, you will live.”1%4

(g) It must now of course be asked whether we are also to
believe that the fathers of old, the patriarchs and prophets,
since they likewise attained perfection, served God in the spir-
it.' Since also “Abraham longed to see the day” of Christ; “and
he saw it and was glad.”'”® And Moses and Elijah appeared in
glory, speaking with Jesus on the mountain."” In this the law
and the prophets are shown to harmonize with the Gospels and
to shine forth with the same glory when viewed and interpreted
spiritually.'®

11. How without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers, asking that by God’s will I may somehow at last at some time

says that he prays without ceasing for those to whom he is writ-
ing, being mindful of his own command, he fulfills in deed what
he has commanded in word.?” He says that he prays that by
God’s will he may somehow at some time at last have a success-
ful journey and may come to the Romans. One should keep in

mind that when the Apostle of God sets out on a holy work, i.e.,
the work of the gospel, he waits until, by means of prayers, he
procures not only a successful journey for himself but also a
success that comes about by the will of God. How much more,
then, this should be the case with us, who do not possess such a
great task or confidence of merit. When we are disposed to un-
dertake something we must request from God success for the
journey.

(2) I think, however, that the Apostle wanted this to be un-
derstood, that the success of a journey is not always accom-
plished by the will of God. After all, even Balaam had a success-
ful journey while going to Balak to curse the people of Israel,?’!
but this success was not by the divine will.?**> Moreover many
people experience successful outcomes in secular affairs and
rejoice in their successes, but such success is not by the will of
God except when there is need of our journey, as the Apostle
specifies here.

12. He says, For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to
you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may be mutu-
ally encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.?* First of
all, we must learn that to long to see Christian brothers is an
apostolic work, but for no other reason except that we might
confer to them some spiritual gift if we are able and, if we are
not able, that we might receive one from them. For apart from
this reason the longing to go around to the brothers is not com-
mendable. When he says, “so that I may impart to you some
spiritual gift,” he is evidently making known that there are gifts
which are not spiritual.*** Certainly the gift of faith is spiritual,
and the gift of wisdom and knowledge and likewise virginity.
But when he speaks of marriage and virginity he says, “But each
has his own gift from God, one having one kind and another a
different kind.”?” Thus he indeed calls marriage a gift, since as
it is written, “A wife is prepared for the husband by the Lord,”?*

but this gift is not spiritual. Many other things as well can be
called gifts of God such as wealth, bodily strength, outward
beauty, and earthly kingdoms. For these too are granted by
God, as even Daniel says, “For he sets up kings and deposes
them,”?” but these gifts are not spiritual. Blessed are those,
therefore, to whom the Apostle wants to impart a spiritual gift
for the strengthening of faith so that they might no longer be
infants [M858] nor borne along by every wind of teaching.?*®
When this is accomplished by Paul, he himself receives encour-
agement seeing his own work strong and stable, and they who
become sharers in the apostolic grace®” are also encouraged.

Jfruit even among you as also among the other nations, the Greeks and
barbarians, the wise and foolish, I am a debtor; thus for my part I am
eager to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in Rome*'” There is a
hyperbaton?®'! in this passage and it is a rhetorical ellipsis. We
can render the hyperbaton as follows: “I want you to know,
brothers, that I have often intended to come to you in order
that I may have some fruit both among you as also among the
other nations, the Greeks and barbarians, the wise and foolish,

may be completed in the following way: In the place where he
says, “also among the other nations, the Greeks and barbarians,
the wise and foolish,” it appears that the words “to whom” are
missing. What follows should read this way, “to whom I am a
debtor.” The logical order might be, “Just as I have fruit among
the other nations, the Greeks and barbarians, the wise and fool-

been ashamed to preach the gospel among any nation because
the power of God is in it for salvation to all who believe, first for
the Jew and then for the Greek.”?'2 For in the gospel the right-
eousness of God is revealed which had been concealed previ-
ously, being hidden in the law. But it is revealed to those who
go from the faith of the old covenant to the new faith of the
gospel; just as it was predicted in the prophet: The “righteous,”
even if he is still under the law, by believing in God and in his
servant Moses,?'® “lives out of faith.”?'* And when he comes to
the gospel from the faith of the law he is led to faith in Christ
and thus advances from faith to faith.?'s

(2) These things should be said as far as pertains to the logi-
cal coherence of the words of the Apostle. But now, let us inves-
tigate what contributes to understanding. He shows his love for
the Romans when he says, “For I have often intended to come
to you.” If we think that what he adds, “but thus far I have been
prevented,” means that he has been prevented by God, it is
shown through this as well that it matters to God where each of
the apostles ought to go or not to go, and that by a kind of su-
perintendence he allows the word of God to be preached to
some but prevents it from being preached to others. As he says
elsewhere, “And when we tried to enter into Bithynia the Spirit
of Jesus prevented us.”?'® And in the Gospels the Savior says,
[M859] “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God, but to others it is in parables, so that seeing
they may not see, and hearing they may not hear.”?”

(3) However, if “but thus far I have been prevented” is relat-
ed to what he says in another passage, “Satan hindered us,”*®
then he is suitably revealing here that he is struggling without
ceasing in prayer®'? in order that, when the hindrances of Satan
have been overcome, his journey might become successful by
the will of God to see those who are in Rome. For he longs for
this and does not cease to supplicate in his prayers that he
might receive some fruit from them, as from the other Gentiles.

It is as if Paul, desirous of great wealth and returning from his
many spiritual investments, longs to gather in. He gathers fruit
from the Greeks, he gathers some from the barbarians, he gath-
ers some from the wise, and he even collects some from the
foolish.??” Whereas he speaks wisdom to some as to the perfect,
to others as to the foolish, he claims to know nothing at all ex-
cept Christ Jesus and him crucified.??® Whereas he teaches
some out of the law and the prophets, others he convinces by
signs and wonders.

(4) Truly Paul bears all these fruits because like a good
branch he remains in the true vine, who is Christ. He whom the
Father, as the vine grower, frequently prunes, also for that rea-
son bears much fruit;**? but he prunes him through labors,
afflictions, and persecutions. For there are other branches who
abide in the vine but do not bear fruit but are withered. From
these are the ones which remain in Christ in name but in works
and deeds are found unfruitful and withered. They are said to
be cut off by the Father and cast into the fire.?”® For the first
Adam was a type of vine?* and the root of the human race
which produced certain fruitful branches, such as Seth, Enosh,
Enoch, and the rest until Noah, but he produced others which
were unfruitful and useless, such as Cain and all the offspring
generated from him. Likewise in Christ, who is the last Adam,?*
there are some fruitful branches that are bearing fruit in the
true vine, but also others that are withered and should be cut
off by the Father, the vine grower.??

(5) Note the following as well: the Apostle designates the
fruit of good things in the singular, just as he does in another
passage, “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace”;?*” but the
works of the flesh which he reproaches he mentions in the plu-
ral.?®® Now if someone objects to this observation by citing what
is written in the Psalm, “You shall enjoy the labors of your

fruits,”* where fruit is properly designated in the plural, he

should realize this: Just as the man who dealt with many pearls
but who discovered one [M860] of very great value sold every-
thing and bought that one pearl,?’ in the same way someone
who begins with many fruits ought to strive for the one fruit of
perfection.?!

(6) At this point it must be asked in what sense the Apostle is
a debtor to Greeks and barbarians, to the wise and foolish. For
what had he received from them which would cause him to be
indebted to them? In my opinion he has become a debtor to
the various nations because, through the grace of the Holy
Spirit, he had received the ability to speak in the tongues of all
the nations, as he himself says, “I speak in more tongues than
all of you.”*? Accordingly, since a person receives the knowl-
edge of tongues not for his own sake but for the sake of those
to whom he is supposed to preach, he becomes a debtor to all
those, the knowledge of whose language he has received from
God. He becomes a debtor to the wise, however, because he re-
ceived wisdom hidden in a mystery which he was supposed to
speak to the perfect and the wise.?® But how is he indebted to
the foolish? Because he has received the grace of patience and
longsuffering; for it is a gesture of supreme patience to bear
with the foolish.

(7) But he has most graciously added in the words which fol-
low, “thus for my part I am eager to proclaim the gospel to you
also.”?! He testifies that he is eager, for in another passage he
says, “For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward.”*® Surely a
person is eager to speak to the wise. But with respect to the
foolish we must take into consideration what he says, “but if I
am not willing, then a commission has been entrusted to
me”;*% and, “for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.”?”

14. For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God for
salvation to everyone who believes.® Many reproaches against the
gospel arose at the beginning of its proclamation, but Paul had
learned patient endurance from the prophets, saying, “Do not
be conquered by their reproaches, and do not yield when they
revile you.”” He knew that he had to preach the gospel “not
with plausible words of human wisdom, but in the power of the
Spirit.”** In defining what the gospel is, therefore, he declares,
“for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who be-
lieves, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.” When he says, “It
is the power of God for salvation,” he seems to be revealing that
there is some power of God which is not for salvation but in-
stead for destruction. He knows of course that it is written in
the prophet, “And the locust is my great power”;*!! and again in
the Psalms it says, “Destroy them with your power”;>*? and there-
fore he says here, “the power for salvation.” It must be seen,
then, whether perhaps it is on account of these different kinds
of powers of God that there is talk of the right and left hand of
God.?* In this way the power unto salvation is called his right
hand and the power by which he destroys is called his left hand.
Because Christ is called the power of God*** and the gospel also
is called the power of God, the following ought to be consid-
ered: whether [M861] Christ, as he is many other things, ought
also to be understood as the gospel. Indeed perhaps what is
called the “eternal gospel”?* should be interpreted with refer-
ence to him.

(2) He says, “to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and to
the Greek.”?® The Greeks were the first to assess the entire hu-
man race with two designations, saying that every single human
was either a Greek or a barbarian. In fact for them the distinc-
tion was such that everyone who was not a Greek was regarded
as a barbarian. Paul makes use of a much more accurate distinc-
tion by naming the Jews first, the Greeks next, and the barbar-

ians in the last position. For although the Greeks may have
named all the rest of humanity living without laws as barbarians
(since the Greeks themselves did make use of laws), the Apostle
rightly puts the Jews ahead of the Greeks since they began to
live under laws before the Greeks.?*” Moreover their laws were
promulgated by God, rather than men.

15. For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to
faith.**® The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel
through the fact that with respect to salvation no one is exclud-
ed whether he should come as a Jew, Greek, or barbarian. For
the Savior says equally to all, “Come to me, all you that labor
and are burdened.”?** But concerning the words “from faith to
faith” we have already said above®° that the first people who
had believed God and his servant Moses?! were also in the
faith; from this faith they now transfer over to the faith of the
gospel.®? But it says this from the testimony of the prophet
Habakkuk, “the righteous lives by my faith.”?? Either it means
that he who is under the law must believe in the Gospels as well,
or that he who is under the Gospels must also believe in the law
and the prophets. For a person does not possess complete life
who has one but not the other.?*

16. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungod-
liness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the
truth. Because what is known of God has been manifested to them, for
God has manifested it to them.* In other places we have spoken
more fully concerning the wrath of God;*® however let a few
things be said at this time as well. So then, it is said that the
wrath of God is now being revealed not against a certain part

but against all ungodliness and wickedness; however, not in all
men but only in those who, to be sure, hold fast to the truth
[M862] but suppress it by their wickedness. He says that what is
known about God is manifest to them. This shows that there is
something about God that may be known and something about
him that may not be known. That is why he says the wrath of
God is being revealed to those who suppress the truth by their
wickedness. What is revealed is brought forth from obscurity
and hiddenness into the state of being known. Since therefore
it is said here as well that the wrath of God is revealed from
heaven not against those who are ignorant of the truth but
against those who hold fast to it, although they hold fast to it in
a bad way, evidently he is saying that the rationale for and
knowledge of the wrath of God are manifested in those who
know the truth, even though they suppress it in wickedness.*”
As he declares in what follows, this is interpreted as having
been spoken about the wise men of this world and the scholars
and the philosophers. Although they knew the truth and right-
eousness of God, “they did not honor him as God or give
thanks to him, but they became bankrupt in their thinking,”
having turned to idols.*® And “claiming to be wise, they be-
came fools,” for “they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible
God for the likeness of the image of man and birds and four-
footed animals and reptiles.”*

(2) With these words the Apostle also makes known the fol-
lowing: That which the wise men of this world have attained in
respect to the knowledge of the truth, they have attained as
God reveals them. But as long as they strive for vain glory or
fawn over ancient errors or become intimidated by fear of the
rulers, they themselves become the judges of their own damna-
tion. The truth which they had known by divine revelation they
either covered up when they denied the existence of freedom
or they rejected through the wickedness of their deeds.?*

(g) Well then, wrath sometimes seems to refer to that power
which governs the ministers of punishments and inflicts penal-
ties which govern sinners.?! I hold the view that this is the
meaning of the text which reports that the wrath of God incited
David to command Joab to take a census of the people.?> More-
over both his ministers and associates are also indicated in the
passage which says, “He sent against them the wrath of his fury,
affliction, and wrath through evil angels.”?® Sometimes even
the pangs of conscience are named wrath?** when we clarify
“avengers” and “punishers,” as the Apostle also says, “you are
storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath”;*® and in an-
other passage, “as their thoughts among them mutually accuse
or even defend them on the day when God will judge the se-
crets of men.”% Moreover the affliction of distress or of a trial
is called the wrath of God, [M864g] as Job says, “The wrath of
the Lord is in my body.”?%"

(4) But why is it said that the wrath is now being revealed
from heaven? Perhaps in order to distinguish it from another
wrath which is not from heaven, as for example, “Their wine is
the fury of dragons and the incurable fury of serpents.”?® Or
perhaps, because those against whom this word is being direct-
ed are said to be sinning not in ignorance but in the knowledge
of the truth, for that reason it is said that the punishment is be-
ing directed against them from heaven, from where the minis-
ter of the punishments receives his authority.?® But unquestion-
ably, since the spiritual forces of wickedness against whom we
engage in combat are said to be in the heavenly regions,?” it
logically follows that, in those persons who are vanquished by
these evil beings, wrath is said to be hurled at them from heav-

God, but he is more negative about the way in which the philosophers made
use of this capacity.”

en. It is just as if we were to say that flaming missiles are being
shot at them from there?”! and they are receiving wounds from
on high by which they fall into sins. For in reality those who are
totally devoid of the truth, as if they have nothing in common
with heaven and with the light, are bearing the wrath of their
own vices and sinful passions, or of the demons to which they
have willingly subjected themselves.

(5) “Against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who sup-
press the truth by their wickedness.” “Ungodliness” refers to sin
against God, “wickedness” to sin against men. Therefore he
who by his wickedness suppresses the truth sins against God
and against men. We are to believe that men have known this
truth by means of the natural reasoning capacities which God
has implanted into the soul. Enough wisdom has been granted
to them that they should recognize what is known of God, that
is, what can be perceived about God by way of inference from
the creation; from the things which can be seen, his invisible
things ought to be recognized.?”? Therefore, by his covenant,
the just judgment of God will be just even against those who be-
fore the arrival of Christ turned away from the worship of God,
although they were able to recognize him, and turned to the
adoration of images of men and of animals.?”® To put it briefly
and in one compressed definition we could say: To worship any-
thing besides the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit is a
crime of ungodliness.

(6) “For what is known of God has been manifested to them,
because God has manifested it to them.”*"* We have already said
above?™ that what we are able to comprehend by the progres-
sion of this world and by reason is “known of God.” This is what
the Apostle himself indicates when he says that his invisible
things can be contemplated through the things which have
been made.?”® However the knowledge of his substance and na-
ture must be understood to be a matter that is “unknown of
God.” In my opinion the kind of proper nature he possesses is

something which is concealed not only from us human beings
but from every created being. Now whether at some time our
rational natures shall have made such great progress that they
may be able to attain to this knowledge too, only God knows.
Such a thing appears to me [M864] to be hoped for in the Sav-
ior’s words, “For no one knows the Son except the Father; and
no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom
the Son wants to reveal him.”?”” For he would not have added,
“and anyone to whom the Son wants to reveal him,” unless he
knew that there are some to whom he wants to reveal these
things.?”®

17. For his invisible things are perceived from the creation of the
world, having been understood through what has been made, and his
eternal power and deity, so that they might be without excuse; for
though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks,
but they became bankrupt in their thinking, and their foolish heart was
darkened. For claiming to be wise, they became fools and they exchanged
the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of the image of cor-
ruptible man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.*™ In
what has been said above we have already discussed nearly all
the details of these verses. For we said*® that these things, al-
though they pertain to all men in whom natural reason exists,
are directed in particular to the wise men of this world and
those who are called philosophers, whose job it is in particular
to discuss the created things of the world and everything which
has been made in it. They use reason to draw conclusions about
the things which are not seen from the things which are seen.?!
One should of course recognize that the invisible things which
he names here refer to created beings.??

(2) The same Apostle also writes about these beings in an-

277. Mt 11.27. 278. Cf. Comm in Jn 1.16; 20.7.

281. Cf. Cels 3.47; 6.4; 7.46.

282. By “invisible things” he evidently means incorporeal spiritual powers,
i.e., angels, in contrast to God’s invisible uncreated nature. Schelkle, Paulus,
Lehrer, p. 55, notes that Origen does not tell us how this recognition is supposed
to take place. Cf. Princ 1.7.1.

other passage, “For through him,” i.e., through Jesus Christ,
“all things were made, whether things in heaven or on earth,
things visible and invisible.”?® And for that reason, in addition
to the things which he had called invisible, he adds, “and his
eternal power and deity.”?®* Therefore, the power of God which
is eternal and his deity which is no less eternal are known by in-
ference from the creation. His power is that by which he rules
all things, his deity is that by which he fills the universe.?*> On
this basis, then, men become without excuse, since although
they knew God (since God made himself known), they have
not, as is fitting, worshiped God or given thanks, but through
their own futile way of thinking, while they seek after forms and
images for God, they have destroyed the image of God within
themselves.?®® Those who were openly boasting to be in the
light of wisdom have fallen into the deep darkness of foolish-
ness. For what is so revolting, so dark, and so gloomy as to turn
the glory of God into the bodily and corruptible effigy of a hu-
man form, as is the custom of those who worship images; to
equate the greatness of the divine majesty with birds and four-
footed animals and reptiles?

18. It was assuredly for these reasons that God most justly
handed them over to the desires of their hearts to impurity, [M865] to
the mutual degrading of their bodies; they exchanged the truth of God
Jfor a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Cre-
ator, who is blessed forever.?®” Each detail recorded here may seem
to be suitably explained according to the faith of the Church,
that the people described here have justly and deservedly
earned God’s abandonment of them for the reasons previously
given for their guilt.?®® The truth which they know by God’s rev-
elation they suppress by their wickedness and on account of be-
ing abandoned they are handed over to the desires of their

ries. This mistaken understanding was repeated by later Fathers.

heart. These were the desires of their heart: that they mutually
devote their own bodies to impurity and defilement. And the
kind of judgment they used against the veneration of the deity
when they transferred the glory of the incorruptible God to dis-
gusting and unworthy forms of men and animals was the same
judgment they used in turn against themselves, that rational
human beings live after the fashion of irrational beasts.

(2) Nevertheless, let us ask those who deny that the good
God is also a just judge®®® what shall they say in response to
these things which the Apostle says, namely that God “handed
them over to the desires of their heart to impurity, to the de-
grading of their bodies”? For in this not only will their system,
once completely excluded, be forced out, but even our own ex-
planation. For how shall it be just that whoever is handed
over—granted that it is on account of their own sins that they
are handed over—nonetheless are handed over to lusts and
handed over to this, to the devotion of their own bodies to im-
purities and lusts? For example, anyone who is handed over to
the dungeon for punishment cannot be charged with the accu-
sation that he is in darkness. Or, anyone handed over to fire
cannot, for this very reason, be blamed for why he is burnt.
Likewise in the case of those who are handed over to sinful de-
sires and impurities so that they degrade their bodies, it will not
seem fitting for them to be charged when, situated amongst
lusts and impurities, they defile their bodies with degradations.

() Well then, Marcion and all who spring forth from his
school like a brood of vipers shall not dare to touch the solu-
tion of these matters, not even with their fingertips,*° since
they have thrown away the Old Testament on account of these
sorts of problems, wheresoever they happened to have read
such things in it. But what good did it do them? For they are no
less strangled by similar problems in the New Testament.*"

just, of the law and the prophets and the Gospels, the Father of
Christ, we make use of the same explanations in both the New
and Old Testament.?”* We call upon him who placed in Zion a
stone of stumbling and a rock of offense?® to reveal to us
through his own Holy Spirit the explanation of the stumbling
block and offense [M866] of the apostolic reading on account
of which doubting minds are tripped up.

(5) We frequently find in the Scriptures, and we have often
discussed this topic, that man may be said to be spirit, body,
and soul.?* And when it is said, “The flesh desires contrary to
the spirit, and the spirit desires contrary to the flesh,”? the
soul is undoubtedly placed in the middle. Either it gives assent
to the desires of the spirit or it is inclined toward the lusts of
the flesh. If it joins itself to the flesh it becomes one body with
it in its lust and sinful desires;*¢ but if it should associate itself
with the spirit it shall be one spirit with it. It is after all for this
reason that the Lord says in the Scriptures concerning those
whose souls had been united completely with the flesh, “My
Spirit shall no longer abide in these men, for they are flesh.”?”
But concerning those whose soul had united with the spirit the
Apostle says, “But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit.”?%

(6) Moreover, as we find in many scriptural passages, there
are angels who are patrons and helpers for both sides, or rather
for the two ways.?” For the devil and his angels and all the evil
spirits in the heavenly regions together with all the principali-
ties and powers and rulers of the infernal parts of this world
against whom human beings must do battle®” support the flesh
in its lust against the spirit.*! But on the other hand, all the
good angels support the spirit as it struggles against the flesh

and attempt to summon the human soul, which is intermedi-
ate, to itself. The Lord says about these angels, “Their angels
see the face of your Father in heaven.”™? The Apostle also
speaks about them in Hebrews,” “Are they not all ministering
spirits sent to serve for the sake of those who are receiving the
inheritance of salvation?”®* The Lord himself also lends his
support, inasmuch as he even laid down his own life for his
sheep.’®

(7) But out of both sides’ support, the duty of choice is pre-
served. For the matter is not done by force nor is the soul
moved in either of the two directions by compulsion.*”® Other-
wise neither blame nor virtue could be ascribed to it, nor would
the choice of the good earn a reward or the turning aside to
evil merit punishment. Instead the freedom of will is preserved
in the soul in all things, so that it may turn to what it wants, just
as it is written, “See, I have set before you life and death,”?"
“fire and water.”?*® Life, therefore, is Christ,’” and death refers
to the last enemy,®'” the devil. The soul therefore makes its own
decision whether it wants to choose life, that is Christ, or to
turn aside to death, the devil.?!!

(8) But suppose the soul, while recognizing God, should fail
to embrace Christ, its life. Suppose it should not honor him
[M86%7] as God or give thanks, but should become bankrupt in
its thinking and exchange the glory of the incorruptible God
for the likeness of the image of corruptible man and birds and
fourfooted animals and reptiles and through all these things,

should turn aside to the flesh and to those beings which lend
support to the desires of the flesh. If that should happen it shall
doubtlessly be forsaken and abandoned by those beings which,
by their support, were encouraging it to be joined with the spir-
it. They withdraw from it or hand it over to the desires of its
own heart, by which it is united and joined to the flesh. Certain-
ly they shall not call back a soul which is resisting or reluctant
to the things which it has avoided and spurned.

(9) If the depiction of this matter still seems unclear, let us
make it less obscure and more plain by using an illustration.??
Let us imagine that there is a certain home in which the soul
dwells together with the body and the spirit, as it were with a
pair of counselors. In front of the entrance of this home stands
piety and all the virtues with her. But on the other side are un-
godliness and every sort of excess and lust. They are all waiting
for a nod from the soul: Which of these two troops watching be-
fore her doors does she want to have let in to herself, which
does she want to repel? Suppose the soul, in compliance with
the spirit and yielding to the better counselor, summons to her-
self the troop led by piety and modesty. Will not the other group
which has been spurned and repudiated go away? But suppose
the soul, yielding to the counsels of the flesh, lets into her home
the ungodly lustsquad. Then that whole crowd, led by holiness
and piety, over which the soul preferred the counsel of the evils,
shall withdraw with righteous indignation and leave the soul to
the sinful desires of her own heart. The result will be that she
degrade her own bodies among herself. The soul has exchanged
the truth of God for a lie and, letting into herself the servants of
ungodliness and faithlessness, worships and serves the creature
instead of the Creator, who is blessed forever.

(10) It is of course for these reasons that the human soul
comes into so hazardous a position at a critical moment like
this, but this is not to be discussed in the present passage. So
then, it is the lot of those who are zealously devoted to images to
degrade their own bodies, and for those who have abandoned
the Creator to worship the creation. We, however, worship and

g312. Cf. 2.1.3.


--- Page 38 ---

BOOK 1, CHAPTER 19 97

adore only the Father and the Son and Holy Spirit and no creat-
ed thing. Just as we do not wander into error in our worship, so
we do not sin even in our actions and manner of life, nor do we
imitate those who mutually degrade their own bodies, consider-
ing what the Apostle says, “Do you not know that your bodies
are members of Christ?”*"® and again, “Your body is a temple of
the Holy Spirit.”*"* As members of Christ and a temple of the
Holy Spirit let us preserve our bodies [M868] in all holiness
and purity so that they might become worthy not only for angels
to enter but indeed also to be a habitation of the Holy Spirit
and a dwelling place of the Father and the Son, who said of the
one who abides in his commands, “I and the Father will come
and make a dwelling place with him.”%

19. For this reason God handed them over to degrading passions.
For their women exchanged natural use for unnatural. In the same way
also the men, giving up the natural use of a woman, were inflamed
with their desire for one another, men committing shameless acts with
men and recerving in their own persons the wage which was due for
their error. And since they did not approve to acknowledge God, God
handed them over to a base mind that they might do things that should
not be done. They were filled with every kind of iniquity, malice,
profligacy, covetousness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, spite, they
were gossips, slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, in-
venlors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, disorderly, without affec-
tion, without mercy. Although they knew the righteousness of God,*'®
that those who practice such things deserve to die, not only do they do
these things but they also consent to those who practice them. Therefore
you have no excuse, O man, all of you who judge; for in passing judg-
ment on another you condemn yourself. For you who judge, do the very
same things.>"

(2) For the third time we find it formulated by the Apostle,
“God handed them over.” He gave the following as reasons for
the first “handing over”: “For though they knew God, they did

315. Cf. Jn 14.23. See also Comm in Cant 2.8.

not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became bank-
rupt in their thinking, and they exchanged the glory of the in-
corruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible
man and birds and fourfooted animals and reptiles.” “There-
fore,” he says, “God handed them over to the desires of their
hearts unto impurity, to the degrading of their bodies.”*'® He
seems to set forth the reason for the second “handing over”
when he says, “because they exchanged the truth of God for a
lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the
Creator.” “For this reason,” he says, “God handed them over to
degrading passions.”®® This second “handing over,” however,
seems to be responsible for more serious acts of shame. “For
their women,” he says, “exchanged natural use for unnatural. In
the same way also the men.”** [M869] He seems to give the rea-
sons for the third “handing over” when he says, “And since they
did not approve to acknowledge God, God handed them over
to a base mind that they might do things that should not be
done. They were filled with every kind of iniquity, malice,” and
the other wicked things which he subsequently enumerates.!

(3) The distinctions between these reasons, however, do not
appear to me to correspond adequately to the crimes to which
each person has been subjected. For why is he who serves the
creature handed over to baser acts of shame than he who ex-
changes the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of
an image of corruptible man and birds and four-footed animals
and reptiles? Or why are those who did not approve to acknowl-
edge God handed over beyond either of these other two as it
were to some kind of examination of vices?

(4) It therefore seems to me that all the reasons presented
for the individual instances of “handing over” should be
amassed together in a unity, as well as the notions of “handing
over.” Thus we could say, for example: Because certain men ex-
changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of
an image of man and birds and fourfooted animals and rep-
tiles, and because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and
worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, and

BOOK 1, CHAPTER 19 99

because they did not approve to acknowledge God, therefore,
on account of all these things, God handed them over to the
desires of their hearts unto impurity, to the mutual degrading
of their bodies. He also handed them over to degrading pas-
sions so that their women exchanged natural use for unnatural.
In the same way also the men. Moreover God handed them
over to a base mind that they might do what should not be
done, these people who were filled with every iniquity, malice,
profligacy, and greed, and who were full of envy, murder, strife,
deceit, and the other evils which are recorded. And those who
had known God’s righteousness, that those who practice such
things deserve to die, not only do these things but even consent
with those who practice them. And therefore, on account of all
these evils, they will be without excuse when they judge and
condemn others for the crimes they themselves practice. For
such a person is making a pronouncement about himself when
he punishes another for the things which he himself commits.

(5) I think that [M870] enough has been said above con-
cerning the kinds of “handing over,” i.e., the sense in which
God is said to hand over those whose deeds and mind he
shrinks back from and deserts because it turns away from him
and indulges in the vices. I consider it superfluous to repeat
these things. Doubtless there are two things which I think are
indicated in this passage. It seems each of them point to the
other. First, it is certain that if God hands anyone over either to
the desires of his own heart or to degrading passions or to a
base mind, then immediately a whole crop of crimes arises in
the one who has been handed over, as in a worthless and reject-
ed land.*? Second, if someone, who although he has known
God, should not honor him as God or give thanks but should
be such as the apostolic discourse describes in detail, it is
scarcely to be doubted that the soul of such a person has been
forsaken by God and handed over. For it is not possible for God
to have a dwelling with these evils or for these evils to proceed
from a place where God dwells.

(6) In fact the Apostle seems to have enumerated all the
forms of ungodliness collectively under these three heads: the

g22. Cf. Heb 6.8.


--- Page 41 ---

100 ORIGEN

ungodliness of those who worship idols, that of those who serve
created things rather than the Creator, and that of those who
have not approved to acknowledge God. Under the first head
he intends pagans in general; under the second he describes
their wise men and philosophers. It is my opinion that under
the third head the heretics may be intimated, either those who
deny that God is the Creator or those who utter various blas-
phemies against the Most High.?*> Well then, if, as I have said
above, each of these classes of people, represented under these
headings, is said to have gone astray in the worship of deity, let
us who seem to be in the Church and who hold fast to the right
faith pay close attention to ourselves.’** Let us examine our-
selves with all circumspection lest, while set apart from these
things in only the name of the true worship, we associate our-
selves with these matters and affairs.

(7) For example, it is certain that a man who is filled with in-
iquity, malice, profligacy, and greed has not approved to ac-
knowledge God and belongs to the number of those whom
God has handed over to a base mind. Moreover in the case of
those whose women or men, by abandoning their natural use,
are inflamed with a passion for unnatural use, it is certain that
they are of the number of those who serve created things
rather than the Creator and whom God has handed over to de-
grading passions. Furthermore, when people degrade their
own bodies in impurity, they belong to the number of those
who have exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God. Ex-
cept that the one who is already a believer who defiles the tem-
ple of God*® is guilty of a greater sacrilege than a profane man
who defiles the temple of idols. [M871]

(8) Obviously the passage in which the Apostle says, “they ex-
changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of
the image of man,” must not be left behind.?* This text must
be understood as exposing not merely those who worship idols,
but also as refuting the Anthropomorphites who are in the
Church, who claim that the image of God is the bodily form of
man. They are unaware that it is written in the book of Genesis

325. Cf. Ps 79.81f. See 2.14.11. 324. Cf. Gal 6.1.

BOOK 1, CHAPTER 19 101

that man was made in the image of God.**” Now of which man
this text ought to be understood, the Apostle himself explains
when he says, “having laid aside the old man with his deeds,”
and, “having put on the new who has been created according to
God.”* You hear that he says that the new man is created ac-
cording to God. But in another passage he calls this same new
man “the inner man.” In fact he identifies the corruptible
man, whose image he rejects, as the outer man when he says,
“Even though our outer man is being corrupted, our inner
man is being renewed.”* And in order that those who are in
error concerning the image of God might know [M8~%2] his
meaning still more clearly, let them hear which one the Apostle
says is the man who has been created in the image of God. He
writes in Colossians, “Do not lie, seeing that you have stripped
off your old man with his deeds and have put on the new, who
is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of him
who created him.”*! From these words he plainly shows that it
is the inner man, which is being renewed through knowledge,
who has been created in the image of God. But those who say
that the outer man, that is, the bodily and corruptible man, is
in the image of God are, by the Apostle, in company with those
who have exchanged the glory of God for the likeness of the
image of corruptible man.*® It was indeed necessary that not
even these things be omitted from the explanation of the Apos-
tle’s discourse so that even in this section of the Apostle’s writ-
ing as well as in many other passages, the Anthropomorphites,
that is to say, those who say that the bodily form of man is the
image of God, may recognize themselves as having been ex-
posed and refuted.
